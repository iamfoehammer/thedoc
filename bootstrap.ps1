# This is the Windows-native counterpart to bootstrap.sh. Linux/macOS/WSL/Git
# Bash users should use the bash one-liner from the README instead.

thedoc bootstrap (PowerShell)

Usage:
  irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamfoehammer/thedoc/main/bootstrap.ps1 | iex

What it does:
  1. Clones the thedoc repo to a temp directory.
  2. Runs setup.ps1 from there. The wizard moves the repo to
     wherever you point it at (typically $HOME\GitHub\thedoc) and
     adds it to your User PATH.
  3. Wires ~/.secrets.ps1 into your PowerShell profile so
     llm-secrets.ps1 env vars auto-load in new sessions.

Requirements:
  - git on PATH (Git for Windows or any PowerShell-accessible git)
  - PowerShell 7+ (pwsh, not Windows PowerShell 5.1)

Manual install (no irm | iex):
  git clone https://github.com/iamfoehammer/thedoc.git $HOME\GitHub\thedoc
  $env:PATH = "$HOME\GitHub\thedoc;$env:PATH"
  Add-Content $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts 'if (Test-Path "$HOME/.secrets.ps1") { . "$HOME/.secrets.ps1" }'
  .\thedoc.ps1
'@
    exit 0
}

# bootstrap.ps1 then exits 0 - a caller using `pwsh -File bootstrap.ps1`
# (or any wrapper that reads $LASTEXITCODE) would think the install
# succeeded. Doesn't matter for `irm | iex` since iex evaluates in the
# current scope and exit-statement terminates the pipeline directly,
