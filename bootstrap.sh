thedoc bootstrap

Usage:
  bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamfoehammer/thedoc/main/bootstrap.sh)

What it does:
  1. Clones the thedoc repo to a temp directory.
  2. Runs setup.sh from there. The wizard moves the repo to
     wherever you point it at (typically ~/GitHub/thedoc).
  3. Adds thedoc to your PATH and sources ~/.secrets in your
     shell rc, so 'thedoc' just works in new terminals.

Requirements:
  - git on PATH
  - bash 3.2+ (macOS default; any modern Linux is 4+/5+)

Manual install (no curl pipe):
  git clone https://github.com/iamfoehammer/thedoc.git ~/GitHub/thedoc
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/GitHub/thedoc:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  thedoc
EOF
        exit 0
        ;;
